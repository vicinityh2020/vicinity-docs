VICINITY Neighbourhood Manager is a web-based application that creates a platform for users an their IoT infrastructures with an intuitive visual control. The users can contract added-value services that can access their devices connected to the VICINITY Platform to collect data and control them.

It is divided in two repositories, which are the User Interface and the Server.

In VICINITY Neighbourhood Manager, as in regular social networks, it is possible to establish partnerships with other users and gain read or control access to their devices.

The users can set privacy levels to each device and service they have registered in VICINITY. The privacy levels range from:

* Private – Visible only within the user organisation.
* Visible for friends – Visible also for organisations that were befriended.
* Public -  Visible for the whole platform.
